Ethics and Cellphilm

![Having received an acceptance letter for my paper at the 2025 AERA Annual Meeting in the Division of the Social Context of Education, I am thrilled to take another step forward in my academic journey. This is significant, as a place on the program is reserved for only the highest-quality work. AERA receives over 11,000 submissions annually, and all submissions undergo rigorous review by highly qualified reviewers to ensure excellence.](![McGill University, Ocotber 2024](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fce96237-d9d7-47c4-90cb-85d4148f4aab)
